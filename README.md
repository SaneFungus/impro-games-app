# Impro Games Browser

## About This Project

This is a simple, single-page web application designed to browse, search, and filter a database of improvisational theater games. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it loads all game data from the `impro_games_cleaned.json` file.

This project was created to provide a clean, mobile-first, and responsive interface for accessing a comprehensive list of improv games.

## Features

*   **Full-Text Search:** Instantly search through game titles and descriptions.
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter games by category, primary focus, and minimum number of players.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the game list by catalog number, name, category, or focus.
*   **Game Selection & Export:** Select multiple games and export their details to the clipboard, SMS, or email for easy sharing.
*   **Responsive Design:** A clean, neo-bauhaus inspired interface that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with modern features like CSS variables)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** No frameworks or libraries are used for the core application logic.

## How to Run

This is a static web page. No build process or server is required.

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

The application will automatically load the game data from the `impro_games_cleaned.json` file located in the same directory.
